python311Requests

My Python project for Code Louisville

You will need to:

1) Clone and download files from GitHub
2) Open July_2018_311_Requests_Louisville, KY.ipynb in Jupyter notebooks through Anaconda
3) Run all of the cells

This project uses a 1-month sample of 311 requests received by the city of Louisville in July 2018. The .csv-file was downloaded from 
the data was found on Louisville Open Data at https://data.louisvilleky.gov/
 
The question I answer in using the data is what was the most reported incident type and total for July 2018.

Libraries Used:
matplotlib
numpy
os
pandas
sqlite3

I notated each step within jupyter notebooks to detail what I did along the way

Please let me know if you have any questions.
